It is the ultimate honor and an incredible thrill to welcome Michelle and her brother, Craig Robinson, to the 2025 event.” Michelle’s passion for storytelling has set sales records, garnered awards and accolades, and earned her global acclaim. Her memoir, Becoming, spent over 130 weeks on the New York Times Bestsellers list, sold more than 17 million copies worldwide, and won a Grammy Award. American Factory, the first film produced by her and her husband President Barack Obama’s media company Higher Ground, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2020. Upon its release in 2020, The Michelle Obama Podcast was the most successful original in Spotify history, bringing in more women listeners over 40 than any other podcast. Through the Obama Foundation, she founded the Girls Opportunity Alliance, which supports adolescent girls' education and empowerment around the world. She is also a Co-Founder and Strategic Partner of PLEZi Nutrition, working behind-the-scenes to guide the company's mission to be a driver of change and a model for how food and beverage brands can support the health of the next generation. Craig is the Executive Director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and host of the Higher Ground podcast Ways To Win. From 2017-2020, he served as the vice president of Player Development and Minor League Operations for the NBA’s New York Knicks. Previously, he was a Division I head men’s basketball coach at Oregon State and Brown, and spent more than a decade working as a trader in the investment banking industry. SXSW has also recently added additional Keynote and Featured Speakers to the Conference lineup, including Tom Morello, Bryan Johnson, Lars Ulrich, Ben Stiller, Eddy Cue, Holly Herndon, Zane Lowe, Ayanna Pressley, Priscilla Chan, Shreya Murthy, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, and Robert Rodriguez.

From March 7-10, SXSW Comedy highlights some of today’s most compelling comedic voices, featuring standup showcases, improv, conversations, live podcast recordings, and more. Since 2008, the SXSW Comedy Festival has hosted hundreds of acclaimed comedians and performers from all corners of the entertainment industry. The festival connects today’s most influential comedy minds and the next wave of groundbreaking comedic talent with icons from the world of film and television, creating a comedy festival unlike any other. “SXSW hosts countless filmmakers, TV showrunners, and journalists, making SXSW Comedy rather unique among comedy festivals. It’s been a joy to watch so many comedians meet people at this festival who go on to change their lives with projects that live well beyond our stage,” said Charlie Sotelo, Head of the SXSW Comedy Festival. “Watching that ripple effect has been both humbling and deeply satisfying. It’s been a privilege to be a part of it.” All SXSW registrants (Platinum, Interactive, Music, and Film &TV) are welcome at all SXSW Comedy events. 2025 SXSW Comedy Festival Participants Alex English • Anthony Atamanuik • Aparna Nancherla • Bonnie McFarlane • Brian Simpson • Caitlin Peluffo • Chad Damiani • Christina Catherine Martinez • Doug Benson • Drew Dunn • Eddie Pepitone • Godfrey • Greer Barnes • Ian Lara • James Adomian • Jay Jurden • Joe DeRosa • Katherine Blanford • Kristen Toomey • Laura Peek • Lauren Lapkus • Lisa Gilroy • Lynne Koplitz • Maddie Wiener • Matt Besser • Megan Gailey • Melissa Villaseñor • Natalie Palamides • Nick Thune • Nico Carney • Opey Olagbaju • Pete Lee • Punkie Johnson • Reggie Conquest • Rich Vos • Sam Jay • Scott Aukerman • Sean Patton • Stuart Goldsmith • T.J.

Elon* and his co-conspirators seize the SXSW stage to figure out what’s wrong with everything—and fix it with chainsaw-like efficiency. *James Adomian, definitely NOT the real Elon In keeping with tradition, SXSW Comedy welcomes back festival favorites—cornerstone shows that have played a key role in shaping our annual celebration of comedy. Scott Aukerman returns with his hit improv show Comedy Bang! Bang! The Podcast with Lauren Lapkus and a surprise cast of characters. Aukerman is a defining figure in both podcasting and the “alt-comedy” movement, fostering one of the most influential comedy scenes of our generation. Aukerman’s curatorial genius laid the foundation for what became SXSW Comedy. We’re proud to have this long-time festival pillar back on the Esther’s Follies stage for one more go-around. Known for his signature curious and insightful style, Stuart Goldsmith returns with live editions of his hit UK podcast, The Comedian’s Comedian. Goldsmith delves into the nuts and bolts of the comedic process with Scott Aukerman, Pete Lee, and Aparna Nancherla. Doug Benson is back with some friends to record Doug Loves Movies, his hit audience-interactive game show podcast, beloved by loyal comedy and film fans alike. Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre (UCB) cofounder and improv legend, Matt Besser, brings back his cult-favorite podcast and long-time festival mainstay, improv4humans. An incubator to some of the most revered television comedy talent of the past few decades, UCB continues its legacy at SXSW. Besser helms UCB’s longest-running show, ASSSSCAT, where true tales from celebrity guests inspire scenes from some of today’s most skilled improvisers including Lisa Gilroy, Anthony Atamanuik, and more. SXSW Comedy is excited to celebrate the 50th anniversary of LA's legendary Hollywood Improv. The storied club with its iconic brick wall returns with Melissa Villaseñor and other club favorites for An Evening at the Hollywood Improv. New York City institution Gotham Comedy Club upholds its legacy of showcasing the city’s funniest talent as one of the festival’s longtime collaborators with Gotham Comedy Club Presents, featuring Brian Simpson and others. Viral sensation Don’t Tell Comedy presents its first-ever roster of Don’t Tell Comedy All-Stars. Known for its secret comedy shows, popular YouTube channel, and expertly-curated lineups, Don’t Tell Comedy has become a launchpad for emerging talent. The Elysian Theater, the center of LA's burgeoning clown movement, brings its flavor of experimental, outrageous performances to this year’s comedy fest. Elysian Nights ATX is a variety show featuring Aparna Nancherla, Natalie Palamides, and other special talents who are at the heart of this cutting-edge theater. Comedy festival Skankfest and SXSW team up to bring you the festival mashup showcase, Southwest Skankfest. Skankfest has created a playground for loyal superfans and their favorite comics, inspired by the unique community built in the early days of comedy club, The Creek and The Cave. What happens when standups can’t rely on their material to win over an audience? A staple of The Elysian, Stand Up and Clown stars ruthless clown master Chad Damiani as he live-directs polished standups through their first clown show, pushing them to embrace their dumbest instincts in front of a live audience. The Street Meat: A Comedic Celebration of Food Trucks, Grease Pits, and Sandwich Shops is hosted by Joe DeRosa, comedian and proprietor of NYC sandwich shop Joey Roses. DeRosa talks about food with creators of some of the country’s greatest common cuisine… and a comic or two. Acclaimed NYC comedy club, The Stand, produces a slate of live tapings at this year’s festival. Comedian and writer Bonnie McFarlane comes to SXSW for her first independently filmed standup special, None of This Is Real. McFarlane joins husband Rich Vos to host Would You Bang Him?, a comedy game show where female judges determine whether a lineup of male comedians measures up to the show's name. T.J. Miller, Sam Jay, and other club favorites take the stage for The Stand Presents WITZ Live at SXSW.

SXSW 2024 Attendees – Photo by Tico Mendoza The digital SXXpress (South by Express) Passes are a resource for SXSW registrants to not only secure a spot at must-see events but also jump to the front of the line. Daily SXXpress Passes are available to all SXSW Badges – Platinum, Interactive, Film & TV, and Music. Registrants may request priority access for themselves to individual Conference Sessions, Screenings, Music Festival Showcases, and Comedy Festival Showcases. SXXpress passes are based on a small portion of the event room size and are available for our in-person event only. Don’t fret! If you are not able to secure a SXXpress Pass for a certain event, you can still attend by checking Event Status on the Schedule or the SXSW GO mobile app to plan accordingly and by waiting in your designated badge line. SXXpress Passes are digital and can be requested through the SXSW Schedule or in SXSW GO, the official mobile app. Before you can reserve SXXpress Passes, you must log in and link your badge in SXSW GO or SXSW ID, using the SXSW Link Code found in your registration confirmation email. Starting from 9:00am CT on the day before the event (two days before the event for Platinum badges), log in to SXSW GO or the SXSW Schedule, navigate to the event, and click the \"Request SXXpress Pass\" button. You are only able to request a SXXpress pass to an event that you have primary access to. If you are reserving a pass for an eligible event, you will see a “Confirm SXXpress Pass” button and a confirmation email will be sent if the pass is granted. Screenings and Sessions: the request period will end when the limited number of Passes have been claimed or 5 hours before the session, whichever comes first.

Whether you're a first timer or a SXSW veteran, here's a rundown of event access by badge type and more. There are four SXSW Badge types: Platinum, Interactive, Film & TV, and Music. Badges are tied to two access types: Primary: admitted first Secondary: admitted second, after primary line The Platinum Badge offers primary access to all SXSW events, including but not limited to: Conference Sessions, Music Showcases, Film & TV screenings, Comedy Showcases, and networking opportunities. The Interactive Badge gives you access to professional development and learning opportunities with primary entry to all Conference events including sessions, mentors, and workshops. The Interactive Badge also grants you secondary access to a majority of Film & TV screenings and Music showcases, subject to venue capacity. The Film & TV Badge is your pass to nine days of screenings, including world premieres, featuring a high caliber and diverse lineup of Film, TV, and XR during the Film & TV Festival. During the Conference, these badgeholders have primary access to Film & TV sessions, including mentor sessions and workshops. Plus, secondary access to a majority of Interactive and Music programming and Music Festival showcases. The Music Badge is your primary entry key to our legendary Music Festival showcases as well as music programming, mentor sessions, and workshops at the Conference. Plus, secondary access to most Interactive and Film & TV programming, and Film & TV Festival screenings. All badgeholders have primary access to daily Conference Keynotes, Featured sessions, Comedy Festival showcases, Exhibitions, and the Registrants Lounge. Throughout SXSW, you’ll find icons matching your badge type to help you navigate through the event. SXXpress Passes A portion of each event’s capacity is allocated for the SXXpress pass pool, granting front-of-line access to events. Badgeholders can reserve SXXpress Passes that correspond to their badge type in the SXSW GO mobile app and on the SXSW Schedule starting at 9am CST, two days before each event for Platinum badgeholders, and at 9am CST the day before each event for Interactive, Film & TV, and Music badgeholders. Restrictions apply. See SXXpress Pass for details. Event Status allows you to check the current status for ongoing and upcoming events. A Green-Yellow-Red indicator appears on the SXSW GO app, the online SXSW Schedule, and on the digital Event Status Boards located around the Austin Convention Center and other venues. Primary Access Platinum and Interactive badge holders gain primary access to all Conference programming. If you have a Film & TV or Music Badge, you have primary entry to the respective Conference tracks and events that match your badge type. All badgeholders have equal access to daily Keynotes, featured sessions, and 8 designated conference tracks (see Conference Track Timeline). This programming does not have secondary access. Secondary Access For Interactive tracks, if space remains after Platinum and Interactive badgeholders are seated, Film & TV and Music badgeholders will be admitted next. For Music tracks, if space remains after Platinum, Interactive and Music badgeholders are seated, Film & TV badgeholders will be admitted next. For Film & TV tracks, if space remains after Platinum, Interactive and Film & TV badgeholders are seated, Music badgeholders will be admitted next. Encore Sessions Each year at the SXSW Conference, the multitude of topics bring a high demand for sessions across multiple tracks of programming. While Conference sessions can quickly fill up, Encore Sessions provide additional opportunities to experience this season’s most compelling content. Check the SXSW Schedule for Encore Sessions announced daily during the March event. Lining Up for Film & TV Festival Screenings You should arrive 1 hour before screening time. When you arrive, look for the line that corresponds to your badge type. Primary Access Queue Cards are distributed to Platinum and Film & TV badgeholders starting one hour before screening time, and will be handed out until capacity has been met. This ensures your admission as long as you stay at the venue and are in line when seating begins. Buffer Cards will be handed out to remaining badgeholders after all available Queue Cards are distributed. While these cards do not guarantee entry to the venue, they will help Film & TV and Platinum badgeholders to secure a seat if any become available. Secondary Access If seats still remain after Platinum and Film & TV badgeholders are admitted, Film & TV Wristbands, Music Badges, and Interactive Badges may access a screening via the Secondary Access Line. Public Pre-Sale Tickets A limited number of Public Pre-Sale Tickets will be available for select screenings. You can find SXSW Film & TV Festival screenings with Public Pre-Sale Tickets available for purchase here. Please note, if you are a Central Texas resident, planning to attend five or more screenings, consider purchasing a Film & TV Wristband. Eligible zip codes are verified at checkout. Public Day-of Tickets On the day of a screening, if seats still remain after Primary and Secondary Access are admitted, day-of tickets will be sold starting at $30 (plus venue fees) 15 minutes before showtime at the venue box office.

Sensory sensitivities or challenges with sensory regulation are often experienced by individuals with PTSD, dementia, autism and other similar conditions (1 in 6 individuals). One of the major barriers for these individuals is sensitivity to over stimulation and noise, which is an enormous part of this environment. These are the locations of our Mobile Sensory Rooms by KultureCity: Hilton Sensory Room Room 415B in the Hilton Hotel, March 3-14, 10:00am-5:00pm JW Sensory Room Room 207 in the JW Marriott, March 7-11, 10:00am-5:00pm Check back for our KultureCity Social Story! High Sensory Experience Though SXSW itself is a high sensory experience, events across the festival we expect to have more sensory stimulation than attendees may anticipate are marked “High Sensory Experience” on our schedule. Examples of this are conference sessions that include an unexpected light show, performances or social events that tend to be crowded and loud by design, and busy Paramount film premieres that often have unexpected exciting entrances. High Sensory Experience Schedule If you have questions or concerns about any events' content or sensory experience, contact accessibility@sxsw.com. Transportation Austin, in general, is accessible. Be aware that there are some places throughout the City that are historic, or dated and could pose challenges for some who have a disability.
